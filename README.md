# Analysis of a Simple AES Dataset

This repository contains the supplementary materials for the project "Analysis of a Simple AES Dataset". The complete report, detailing the methodology and results, can be found in the report_Task1_Tam_Gabriele.pdf file.

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the security of a simple AES implementation through Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks. The repository provides the scripts used for the implementation and simulation of these attacks.
